A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system.

Depending upon the usage requirements, the following types of databases are available in the market:


## 1. NoSQL database

 These are used for large sets of distributed data.
 They are very efficient in analyzing large size unstructured data that may be stored at multiple virtual servers of the cloud.
 NoSQL database examples include MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDB Cassandra, HBase, Neo4j and CouchDB.

## 2. Relational database.

 They are the most common database systems and are categorized by a set of tables where data gets fit into a pre-defined category.
 The table consists of rows and columns where the column has an entry for data for a specific category and rows contains instance for that data defined according to the category. 
 The Structured Query Language (SQL) is the standard user and application program interface for a relational database.Some examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server 
 The relational database management systems (RDMS) feature much better performance for managing data over desktop database programs
 
 
## 3. Centralised database.

 Information(data) is stored at a centralized location and users from different locations can access this data.
 It contains application procedures that help the users to access the data even from a remote location.
 Authentication procedures are applied for the verification and validation of end users.
 This is all handled by a local area office.


## 4. Distributed Database 

 Just opposite of the centralized database concept, the distributed database has contributions from the common database as well as the information captured by local computers. 
 The data is not all at one place and is distributed at various sites of an organization. 
 These sites are connected to each other with the help of communication links which helps them to access the distributed data easily.
 There are two kinds of distributed database, viz. homogenous and heterogeneous. 
 The databases which have same underlying hardware and run over same operating systems and application procedures are known as homogeneous DDB. Whereas physical locations can be in DDB , the operating systems, underlying hardware and the application procedures can be different at various sites of a DDB which is known as heterogeneous DDB.

## 5. Commercial database.

 These are the paid versions of the huge databases designed uniquely for the users who want to access the information for help. 
 These databases are subject specific, and one cannot afford to maintain such a huge information. 
 Access is provided through commercial links.

## 6. End-user database.

 The end user is usually not concerned about the transaction or operations done at various levels and is only aware of the product which may be a software or an application.
 This is a shared database which is specifically designed for the end user, just like different levelsâ€™ managers. Summary of whole information is collected in this database.

## 7. Operational database.

 Information related to operations of an enterprise is stored inside this database.
 Functional lines like marketing, employee relations and customer service require such kind of databases.

## 8. Personal database.

 Here data is collected and stored on personal computers which is small and easily manageable. 
 The data is generally used by the same department of an organization and is accessed by a small group of people.

## 9. Cloud database.

 In recent years, data has been specifically getting stored over clouds also known as a virtual environment, either in a hybrid cloud, public or private cloud.
 A cloud database is a database that has been optimized or built for such a virtualized environment. 
 There are various benefits of a cloud database, some of which are the ability to pay for storage capacity and bandwidth on a per-user basis, and they provide scalability on demand, along with high availability.
 It also gives enterprises the opportunity to support business applications in a software-as-a-service deployment.

## 10. Object-oriented database.

 An object-oriented database is a collection of object-oriented programming and relational database. 
 An object-oriented database is organized around objects rather than actions, and data rather than logic. 
 For example, a multimedia record in a relational database can be a definable data object, as opposed to an alphanumeric value.

## 11. Graph database.

 A graph-oriented database is a type of NoSQL database that uses graph theory to store, map and query relationships.The graph is a collection of nodes and edges where each node is used to represent an entity and each edge describes the relationship between entities. 
 Graph databases are basically used for analyzing interconnections. For example, companies might use a graph database to mine data about customers from social media.

SQL VS NoSQL DATABASES
============
### The five critical differences of SQL vs NoSQL:
* SQL databases are relational, NoSQL are non-relational.
* SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.
* SQL databases are vertically scalable(which means that you can increase the load on a single server by increasing things like CPU, RAM or SSD), NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable(you can handle more traffic by sharding, or adding more servers in your NoSQL database).
* SQL databases are table based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph or wide-column stores.
* SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, NoSQL are better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.

### NB
## SQL Databases
 The PostgreSQL is the best  SQL database management system because it's a hybrid SQL/NoSQL database system that finds a middle-ground between these two options.
 As a hybrid between a relational database and an object-oriented database, PostgreSQL is excellent when your data doesn't mesh well with a perfectly relational model. 
 It works great for extra-large databases and for performing complicated queries.

## NoSQL Databases
 MongoDB
 
 MongoDB is a good choice for businesses that have rapid growth or databases with no clear schema definitions (have a lot of unstructured data).
